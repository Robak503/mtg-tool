/**
 * effects/effectAtoms.js — the Atom resolver registry (Phase-2 P2.2 keystone).
 *
 * A data table keyed by `Atom.op`, each entry a pure `(state, atom, ctx) => state`
 * resolver. `ctx = { controller, targets }` (the cast-time choices frozen onto the
 * stack object). This is the mechanism that replaces the legacy closure.
 *
 * Parity by construction: the three keystone atoms delegate to the SAME per-effect
 * helpers the legacy `resolveSpellEffect` uses (`spellEffects.applyDamageEffect`
 * etc.), so an EffectProgram of these atoms is byte-for-byte equivalent to the old
 * path — there is no second implementation to drift. New atoms (pump, tokens,
 * counters, …) get their own resolvers in later PRs.
 *
 * Leaf-ish: imports only the shared effect helpers from spellEffects. Does NOT
 * import resolvers or the runner.
