summarizes the notable changes.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Source-available `LICENSE`, plus `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `SECURITY.md`,
  `.gitattributes`, and this changelog.
- First tests for the `spellbook` and `edhrecSalt` modules, and a POST-with-rules test
  for `/api/engine`.

### Changed
- README rewritten for outside readers (the desktop `.exe` build path is now
  documented; stale version/count facts removed).
- Repo root decluttered — 19 AI session-handoff docs moved to `docs/archive/`.
- Licensing reconciled to source-available (was contradictory across docs).

### Fixed
- `/api/engine` returned 500 on POST rules queries (an undefined `TOOL_ROOT`).
- `spellbook` / `edhrecSalt` ignored `MTG_REFERENCE_DIR` and the writable AppData
  override in the packaged `.exe` (they used raw `__dirname`); now resolved through
  `paths.js`.

## Earlier

The project shipped its first phases — knowledge layer, Ollama integration, agent
rewiring, session-manager UI, and the archetype-aware Garfield goldfish — followed by
the Tauri desktop shell with signed auto-update, a card-collection feature, and in-app
data sync. See the git history and GitHub Releases for details.
