summarizes the notable changes.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Source-available `LICENSE`, plus `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `SECURITY.md`,
  `.gitattributes`, and this changelog.
- First tests for the `spellbook` and `edhrecSalt` modules, and a POST-with-rules test
  for `/api/engine`.
- **Midnight Codex** visual theme (indigo-black base, copper accent) across the whole
  app, plus a real-card-art blend on the chat view: the active commander's art backs the
  window behind frosted-glass panels, a commander portrait crowns the right panel, and
  inline card-art plates render on `[[card]]` mentions.
- `/api/art-crop` accepts `?name=` to resolve card art by name via the bundled printings
  index (disk-cached, offline-safe after first view).

### Changed
- README rewritten for outside readers (the desktop `.exe` build path is now
  documented; stale version/count facts removed).
- Repo root decluttered — 19 AI session-handoff docs moved to `docs/archive/`.
- Licensing reconciled to source-available (was contradictory across docs).
- Agent accent colors are now distinct identities: Jace blue, Karn silver, Tibalt deep
  red, Arbiter copper.
- All card art (backdrop, portrait, plates) routes through the local `/api/art-crop`
  proxy — no direct Scryfall CDN calls at runtime, honoring the local-first mandate.

### Fixed
- `/api/engine` returned 500 on POST rules queries (an undefined `TOOL_ROOT`).
- `spellbook` / `edhrecSalt` ignored `MTG_REFERENCE_DIR` and the writable AppData
  override in the packaged `.exe` (they used raw `__dirname`); now resolved through
  `paths.js`.

## Earlier

The project shipped its first phases — knowledge layer, Ollama integration, agent
rewiring, session-manager UI, and the archetype-aware Garfield goldfish — followed by
the Tauri desktop shell with signed auto-update, a card-collection feature, and in-app
data sync. See the git history and GitHub Releases for details.
